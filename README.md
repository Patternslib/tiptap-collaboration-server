## Code style

The release process based on release-it includes automatic changelog generation via conventional-commit, commitlint and a pre-commit hook by husky.
Please check the [code style guide](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/blob/master/docs/developer/styleguide.md#commits-messages) for the commit specification!


## Release

The created package has a Patternslib enabled release workflow.
By default the package lives in the ``@patternslib`` scope on npm.

You might want to change these paramters to fit your release process and accessible npm scopes.
If you believe you need access to the npm ``@patternslib`` scope create an [Issue on Patterns](https://github.com/Patternslib/Patterns/issues).


## Documentation
